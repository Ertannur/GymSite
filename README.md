# GymSite
Cowork of three aspiring Web Programmers on building a Gym Website

This project is going to be a learning platform for us in order to improve our skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Besides the languages, it's also going to be the cooperation skills and gitHub and terminal usage we want to improve ourselfs on.

In our first meeting we discussed about the goals of our website and came up with a rough plan on the layout.
After drafting the page on figma, we're going to transfer our ideas into code.
